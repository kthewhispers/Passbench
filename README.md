# Passbench

Passbench is a **_cross platform_**, highly configurable password benchmarking tool that you can use to understand how secure a password is against a brute-force attack. 

This is a *simple* project I'm doing for experience. I plan to update frequently until the final, completely comprehensive version.

Passbench, a Password Benchmarking Tool, is *completely functional from this initial release*, and **will grow more comprehensive in time**.

Ultimately, Passbench is made with speed, and efficiency in mind in order to provide the most realistic results.

## What is Passbench useful for?

A lot of *people don't know what makes a good password*. In fact, a lot of password requirements on websites and applications actually **reduce the security** of your password. Experimenting with **Passbench allows you to understand what makes a good password**. Such knowledge becomes really useful when you are trying to create a password or passcode for any reason. While brute-force password attacks aren't a huge problem today, this little application's usefulness still stands.

- Passhack features a convienient, intuitive, responsive GUI that is comfortable, and pleasing to the eyes.

- Passbench keeps track of how long it takes cracking the supplied password, giving you the exact time it took after it's finished with a benchmark, even if it takes days.

- Passbench shows you how many times it had to generate a password before it generated the one you supplied.

- Passbench shows you how many passwords per second it makes during the benchmarking session.

- Passbench allows you to choose how many threads it uses to benchmark the password, allowing you to unleash the full power of your CPU, and giving you all the power. You can use a small few threads so you can benchmark and still do other stuff on your machine, or use as many as you please to pull all the power of your machine into Passbench.

  > My suggestion for a Thread count is to experiment with it yourself, as this is a benchmarking tool. I personally suggest that you use   the number of threads(not physical cores) minus 1, or, you can just use the number of physical cores your CPU has. This has yielded the   best results for my machine.
