# Passbench

Passbench is a highly configurable password benchmarking tool that you can use to understand how secure a password is against a brute-force attack. In theory, you could use this program to generate a UTF-8 string of any length (within reason) that can contain numbers, letters, and symbols in any combination. 

This is a project I'm doing for experience. I plan to update frequently until the final, completely comprehensive version.
